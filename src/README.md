#Angular Practical Exercice

The goal of the exercise is to make an application that list pokemon using https://pokeapi.co/ REST API and Angular.

##The requirements are:
* The application should consume https://pokeapi.co/ API to get all the data needed.
* The application should have 2 routes, one for listing and other for details. Ex: /list and /detail/pokemon_name.
* The list view should show the pokemon name and "front_default" sprite (image).
* The user can click on an item in the list and the application will redirect to details route to show more detailed view of that specific item.
* The detail view should show name, id, height and weight values.
* The "height" and "weight" of a pokemon in details view should be shown in an specific component "StatsComponent" which should receive this data as input.

##Bonus requirements (only if you have time)
* The list items should be shown in horizotal tiles with CSS.
* The list is paginated and the user can navigate between pages.
